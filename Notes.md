Let's break this down into **two key concepts** related to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

---

### **1. Hybrid Search (Keyword + Semantic Search)**

Hybrid search combines two retrieval methods:

- **Keyword Search (Sparse Retrieval):** Traditional search using exact text matches (like BM25).
- **Semantic Search (Dense Retrieval):** Uses embeddings (vector representations) to find semantically similar documents.

#### ✅ How it works:

1. **Keyword Search (e.g., BM25):**

   - Retrieves documents that match terms in the query exactly.
   - Good for precision and names/keywords.

2. **Semantic Search (e.g., FAISS, Qdrant):**

   - Transforms the query into a vector using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, BGE).
   - Finds documents with similar vector representations (contextually relevant).

3. **Hybrid Search:**

   - Combines both sets of results — sometimes by:

     - **Unioning** them and re-ranking.
     - **Scoring both** and merging using a weighted formula.
     - **Ensemble models** (e.g., Cohere's hybrid search).

#### 🔍 Why it's useful:

- Handles both keyword-rich queries **and** natural language.
- Increases recall and robustness across query types.

### **2. Reranking RAG Results with FlashRank (and ContextualCompressionRetriever)**

This step happens **after retrieval** to improve quality by prioritizing the most relevant chunks.

#### 🔁 FlashRank Reranker:

- **FlashRank** is a fast, lightweight reranking model.
- Given a query and a list of retrieved chunks, it **assigns relevance scores**.
- It uses cross-attention (like a mini transformer) to **understand context deeply** between the query and each document.
- Often based on models like **BGE-reranker**, **Cohere rerank**, or **MiniLM**.

##### 📈 Example:

```
Top 10 documents retrieved → FlashRank reranks them → Top 3 selected for LLM input.
```

### 🧠 ContextualCompressionRetriever (LangChain):

This is a **smart wrapper** around your retriever to **filter and compress** results based on context.

#### ✅ How it works:

1. You retrieve a lot of documents (hybrid search).
2. `ContextualCompressionRetriever` uses:

   - A **re-ranker** (like FlashRank or BGE).
   - Optionally a **text compressor** (e.g., LLM-based or keyword-based compressor).

3. Only the most **relevant and concise** documents are passed to the LLM.

#### 🔍 Why it's useful:

- Helps **fit more signal in fewer tokens**.
- Avoids wasting token budget on low-relevance chunks.
